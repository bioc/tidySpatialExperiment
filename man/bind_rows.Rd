\title{#' Efficiently bind multiple data frames by row and column}
\value{
`bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` return the same type as
  the first input, either a data frame, `tbl_df`, or `grouped_df`.

\description{
This is an efficient implementation of the common pattern of
`do.call(rbind, dfs)` or `do.call(cbind, dfs)` for binding many
data frames into one.

The output of `bind_rows()` will contain a column if that column
appears in any of the inputs.
