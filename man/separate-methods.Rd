\title{Separate a character column into multiple columns with a regular
expression or numeric locations}
\arguments{
\item{sep}{Separator between columns.

If character, \code{sep} is interpreted as a regular expression. The default
value is a regular expression that matches any sequence of
non-alphanumeric values.

If numeric, \code{sep} is interpreted as character positions to split at. Positive
values start at 1 at the far-left of the string; negative value start at -1 at
the far-right of the string. The length of \code{sep} should be one less than
\code{into}.}

\item{extra}{If \code{sep} is a character vector, this controls what
happens when there are too many pieces. There are three valid options:
\itemize{
\item "warn" (the default): emit a warning and drop extra values.
\item "drop": drop any extra values without a warning.
\item "merge": only splits at most \code{length(into)} times
}}

\item{fill}{If \code{sep} is a character vector, this controls what
happens when there are not enough pieces. There are three valid options:
\itemize{
\item "warn" (the default): emit a warning and fill from the right
\item "right": fill with missing values on the right
\item "left": fill with missing values on the left
}}
}
\value{
A tidySpatialExperiment objector a tibble depending on input
}
\description{
Given either a regular expression or a vector of character positions,
\code{separate()} turns a single character column into multiple columns.
}
\examples{
`\%>\%` <- magrittr::`\%>\%`

\code{\link[=unite]{unite()}}, the complement, \code{\link[=extract]{extract()}} which uses regular
expression capturing groups.
